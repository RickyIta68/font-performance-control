 <p>This php package solves the problem to charge an external font resource<br>                                                 
 with the <strong>"controlling font performance"</strong> using font-display options.<br><br>                                                 
 This option is useful, to fast load the external font and in general to have the control over browser behavioral<br>        
 and, in particular,<br> over how the different browsers have to load the external font.<br>                                     
 This option is useful to make all text remains visible during web font loads,<br>                                           
 leveraging the font-display CSS feature to ensure text is user-visible while web fonts are loading.</p><br><br>                     
 <p>At the moment is no possible to add at any external font resource the font-display options,<br>                             
 when you call the query, for example, through google font API:<br>                                                          
 "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat+Alternates%3A300%2C500"<br>                                             
 and you wish to add the descriptor param: "&font-display=fallback"<br>                                                      
 making something like this query:<br>                                                                                       
 "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat+Alternates%3A300%2C500&font-display=fallback".<br>                      
 Also with the alternative method using @import url(//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans); inside css you are<br>     
 not able to set up the values for font-display.<br> And not even, I think I'm not wrong (I gave only a quick<br>                
 look at this library), with the JavaScript library:<br>                                                                     
 <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/webfont_loader">Web Font Loader </a><br>                                                
 At the moment the only way is the manual set up for each<br>                                                                
 css element: p {font-family: 'MyWebFont', fallback, sans-serif;}</p><br><br>                                                        
 <p>As far as I know, google or someone else has not yet solved this issue and, to work,<br>                                    
 the "font-display" descriptor option must be inserted as value inside the css function @font-face{...}.<br><br>
 <strong> A possible way is, to use the PHP to manipulate this external resourse and add<br>                                          
 the font-display option param inside the css function, moreover, in this way, the API keys, when these are necessary,<br>   
 will be hidden.</strong><br><br>                                                                                                         With this php class there is also the possibility (VIEW:ADVANCED CLASS USAGE EXAMPLE N&deg;2 FILE: INDEX_2.PHP)<br>             
 to load the external fonts (TEN MAXIMUM, PLEASE) all together simultaneously, it is faster but it must be used with extreme<br>     
 caution and with common sense, example file: index_2.php.<br>                                                               
 Ten fonts simultaneously is enough<strong> AND, PLEASE, NOT FROM ONLY ONE SERVER</strong><br> if we                                       want to avoid to commute this demo into a cyber attack to google servers, and if we want to prevent<br>                     
 google killing me and you; I joke, obviously, I joke ... ;)<br>                                                             
 But, obviously, no one load ten fonts simultaneously in only one page. For testing, in the example N&deg;2, fl. index_2.php<br> 
 by forcing the test, I have loaded seven different font simultaneously from only one server,<br>                            
 seven are too much, but I did it only for testing to show<br>                                                               
 that also in this case, with seven different fonts loaded simultaneously, all text remains visible with<br>                 
 the set up of the font-display during web fonts load.</p><br><br>
 <p>To avoid the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/critical-request-chains">critical request chain</a><br>  I have set up to defer (load asynchronously) the style with a small escamotage:<br>                                         
 style media="none" onload="if(media!='all')media='all'"<br><br>
